* Basics

** Prototype

- Possible changes to the Scientific Software Pages
- Just a prototype
  - Just discussing desired content
  - Intentionally terrible Font and minimal styling
- Only high level content discussion
  - What to say, not how to say it
  - Lot's of Lorem Ipsum

* Linear Layout

** Site

[[https://rprospero.github.io/rse-site-demo/][Link]]

** Open Questions

- What other info should be included on the project pages?

- Is there a better way to organise the projects than by technique?

- Is the recent news useful?

* Compact Layout

** Site

[[https://rprospero.github.io/rse-site-demo/compact.html][Link]]

** Open Questions

- Is this better than the extended layout?
- Would we even need the project pages?
- Do we need more/less columns?

* Maintenance

** Maintenance Script

*** Goals

- Allow site maintainer to keep site up to date
- Not require extra work from project teams
- Only require a few minutes a month (amortised)

*** Anti-Goals

- Do not attempt to automate site update

** Implementation

- Every package has a test in the python =unittest= package
- Run the test each month
  - if every test passes, there's nothing to do
- If a test fails, there's probably been an update to a package
  - Update the test to pass again
  - If there's been an update to the package, also update the site
- Intentionally brittle

** Example Script

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def test_dissolve(self):
    version = "1.5.1"

    r = requests.get("https://projectdissolve.com/packages/")
    self.assertEqual(r.status_code, 200)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, features="html.parser")
    actual = soup.select_one('a[href="#release"]').get_text()
    self.assertEqual(version, actual)

#+END_SRC

** Open Questions

- Do we even *want* automation?
  - One person manually tracking all the packages *will* be overwhelmed
  - Requiring developers to send updates to the site maintainer *will*
    be forgotten
- Is this the right tool for the job?
