<p>
RAT is an acronym for Reflectivity Algorithms Toolbox, which is the calculation engine for the forthcoming RasCAL2. As with the original RasCAL, RAT is a toolbox for analysising neutron reflectivity data at multiple contrasts. It is designed to be flexible, allowing analysis using traditional layer models, but also using user defined custom models. These models do not assume any prerequisite, but instead allow complete freedom to the user to specify and parameterise their model however they wish, either as an array of layers, or as a continuous SLD profile. The original RasCAL was written in Matlab, and RAT is too. However RAT is then converted to native C++ using Matlab Coder . This has the advantage of the ease of use of Matlab for development, combined with the power and speed of C++. In addition, because the engine is in C++ it can be called from other languages other than just Matlab. There is a Python interface under development (although not yet functional).</p>
